## 1. Pre-Trip Essentials & Logistics

### Airport Transfer (Highly Recommended)
*   **Recommendation:** **Book a Private Arrival Transfer (Maxi Cab / 7-Seater).**
*   **Why:** For a group of 6 with luggage, a toddler, and seniors, coordinating two separate Grab cars at a busy airport is stressful. A private driver will wait for you at the arrival hall.
*   **Cost:** Approx **SGD $65 - $75**.
*   **Alternative:** Queue for a "Maxi Cab" (7-seater) at the airport taxi stand (flat rate + surcharges), but availability isn't guaranteed.

### MRT & Transport
*   **MRT Passes:** Use foreign **contactless bank cards** (Visa/Mastercard) directly at the gantry (SimplyGo).
*   **Toddler (2-3 years old):**
    *   Travels **FREE**.
    *   **Action:** If taller than 0.9m, bring their passport to the Ticket Office at Changi Airport MRT station to get a **free Child Concession Card**.
*   **Getting Around:** For your group size, a **6-Seater Grab (GrabXL)** is often more convenient and similarly priced to 6 MRT fares for short trips.

### Booking Ahead (Crucial)
*   **Singapore Zoo:** **Mandatory** to book timeslots online.
*   **Singapore DuckTours:** Book a late afternoon slot (4:30 PM or 5:30 PM) for Day 1.
*   **Jacob Ballas:** Free entry, no booking needed, but **check opening hours (Closed Mondays)**.

    *   *Distance from Hotel:* **~1 km** (to Tanglin Gate).
    *   *Transport:* **Walk (10-15 mins)** or Short Taxi ride.
    *   *Activity:* Explore the beautiful UNESCO World Heritage site. You can enjoy a leisurely stroll, see the swans at Eco Lake, or visit the National Orchid Garden (ticketed, but highly recommended). It's a more relaxed start after arrival.

    *   *Transport:* **Taxi/Grab (15 mins)** from Jacob Ballas.

    *   *Why:* Perfect introduction to the city (Marina Bay, Civic District) from both land and water without walking. It’s cooler at this time.

    *   *Distance:* **~2.5 km**.
    *   *Transport:* **Taxi/Grab (5-10 mins)** from Suntec.

    *   *After Dinner:* Walk around Chinatown/Buddha Tooth Relic Temple (Exterior) which is beautifully lit at night.

### **Note on Itinerary Logic (Day 2 vs Day 3)**
*   **Why Sentosa on Saturday?** We scheduled Sentosa first because it offers a mix of indoor (Aquarium) and outdoor activities. This gives your group (especially the toddler and seniors) a chance to **acclimatize** to Singapore's heat with significant breaks in air-conditioning.
*   **Why Zoo on Sunday?** The Singapore Zoo is almost entirely outdoors and is the most physically demanding activity. Placing it on Sunday allows everyone to build up stamina and adjust to the humidity before tackling the "big walk."

### **Day 2: Sentosa Island Fun (Sat, Dec 27)**
*   **09:30:** Transport to **Resorts World Sentosa**.
    *   *Distance from Hotel:* **~9 km**.
    *   *Transport:* **Taxi/Grab (20 mins)** directly to the Casino/Underground drop-off point.
*   **10:00:** **S.E.A. Aquarium**. (Air-conditioned & stroller friendly).
*   **13:00:** Lunch at **Malaysian Food Street** (RWS) or **Din Tai Fung** (RWS) for kid-friendly dumplings.
*   **14:30:** **Skyline Luge & Skyride** (Beach Station).
    *   *Distance:* **~2 km** (Internal Sentosa travel).
    *   *Transport:* Take the **Sentosa Express Monorail** (Free within island) from Resorts World Station to Beach Station.
    *   *Note:* Toddlers under 6 years/110cm can ride the Luge in tandem with an adult.
*   **17:00:** Relax at **Siloso Beach** (Coastes is a nice beach bar) or head back to the city.

    *   *Why:* Public transport (MRT + Bus) takes >1 hour and involves transfers.
*   **09:00:** **Singapore Zoo**.
    *   *Strategy:* Rent a wagon for the toddler. Use the Tram to save the seniors' legs.
    *   *Shows:* Splash Safari (10:30am), Rainforest Fights Back (12:00pm).

## 3. Food & Dining Recommendations

**Local "Must-Eats":**
1.  **Hainanese Chicken Rice:**
    *   *Tian Tian Chicken Rice* (Maxwell Food Centre) - The most famous, expect a queue.
    *   *Boon Tong Kee* (Multiple locations) - Air-conditioned restaurant style, very good.
2.  **Bak Kut Teh (Pork Rib Soup):**
    *   *Song Fa Bak Kut Teh* (Multiple locations, e.g., The Centrepoint near your hotel) - Peppery style, very popular.
3.  **Chilli Crab / Black Pepper Crab:**
    *   *Jumbo Seafood* (Riverside or Dempsey) - Pricey but iconic. **Reservation essential**.
    *   *Keng Eng Kee (KEK) Seafood* (Alexandra Village) - More local/hawker style, famous for "Moonlight Hor Fun" too.
4.  **Kaya Toast (Breakfast):**
    *   *Ya Kun Kaya Toast* or *Toast Box* - Found in almost every mall.
5.  **Dim Sum:**
    *   *Din Tai Fung* (Paragon / Wisma Atria / RWS) - World-famous, very consistent, kid-friendly.

## 4. Addressing Your Questions

1.  **DuckTours Priority & Trade-offs:**
    *   **Verdict:** Doing it Day 1 is a great idea.
    *   **Trade-off:** You might be tired from the flight.
    *   **Solution:** Book a **5:30 PM slot**. This gives you time to rest at the hotel midday and avoids the afternoon heat. It leads perfectly into dinner.
    *   **Jacob Ballas Issue:** We moved Jacob Ballas to Day 1 (2pm) because it is **closed on Mondays**. If 2pm is too hot/rushed, you might have to skip it or visit the main Botanic Gardens on Monday instead.
2.  **Maxwell & Chinatown:**
    *   **Placement:** Day 1 Evening (after DuckTours). It is geographically close to Suntec (DuckTours location) via a short taxi ride.
3.  **Restaurants:**
    *   See the new "Food & Dining Recommendations" section above.
4.  **Private Airport Transfer:**
    *   **Yes, highly recommended.** The convenience of having a driver wait for a group of 6 (with seniors + toddler) outweighs the ~$20 savings compared to coordinating two Grabs. It sets a stress-free tone for the trip.
