## 1. Pre-Trip Essentials & Logistics

### MRT & Transport
*   **MRT Passes for Adults:** You do *not* need to buy special passes beforehand. Simply use your foreign **contactless bank cards** (Visa/Mastercard) or mobile wallets (Apple Pay/Google Pay) directly at the gantry. This is the "SimplyGo" system.
    *   *Note:* A small admin fee (approx $0.50 per day) applies to foreign cards.
*   **Toddler (2-3 years old):**
    *   **Child Concession Card:** Since your child is under 7 years old, they travel for **FREE**.
    *   If the child is **taller than 0.9m**, you need to get a **Child Concession Card** (free of charge) at the Ticket Office at Changi Airport MRT station upon arrival. You will need the child's **passport**.
    *   If the child is **shorter than 0.9m**, they just walk through the gantry with you (carried or strictly followed).
*   **Strollers on MRT:** Elevators are available at every station. Avoid peak hours (8-9am, 6-7pm) if possible, though Dec 26-29 is a holiday period so it should be manageable.

### Payment Methods
*   **Credit/Debit Cards (Visa/Mastercard):** Accepted almost everywhere (Malls, Attractions, Taxis, many Restaurants).
*   **Cash (SGD):** Essential for **Hawker Centres** and small shops. Withdraw cash at Changi Airport ATMs upon arrival.
*   **Apps:** Download **Grab** (for ride-hailing and food delivery) and set it up with your credit card before flying.

### Senior Discounts
*   **Reality Check:** Most "Senior" rates (60+) listed on websites are strictly for **Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents**.
*   **Action:** Purchase standard Adult tickets to be safe. You can ask at the counter, but don't plan your budget around it.

### Booking Ahead (Crucial)
*   **Singapore Zoo:** **Mandatory** to book timeslots online in advance. Tickets can sell out during holiday seasons.
*   **DuckTours / Luge / Aquarium:** Highly recommended to book online (Klook, Pelago, or official sites) to save time and secure slots.

## 2. Strategic Itinerary (Optimized for Efficiency)

**Strategy:** Grouping attractions by location to minimize travel time.
*   **Orchard Area:** Hotel, Jacob Ballas, Orchard Rd.
*   **Sentosa Area:** Aquarium, Luge, Skyride.
*   **Mandai Area:** Zoo (Standalone trip).
*   **City Area:** DuckTours.

### **Day 1: Arrival & Relaxed Exploration (Fri, Dec 26)**
*   **09:45:** Arrival at Changi T4. Immigration & Baggage.
*   **11:00:** Transfer to Hotel (Jen Tanglin). *Recommendation: Book a 6-seater Grab or 2 Taxis. MRT with luggage + toddler + seniors is tiresome.*
*   **12:30:** Drop bags. Lunch at **Tanglin Mall** (connected to hotel) – plenty of cafes/food court options.
*   **14:30:** **Jacob Ballas Children's Garden**.
    *   *Transport:* Short taxi ride or a nice walk through Botanic Gardens (if weather permits, but it's humid).
    *   *Note:* Closes at 7pm. It is a fantastic, free, dedicated garden for kids.
*   **17:00:** Back to Hotel to freshen up.
*   **18:30:** **Orchard Road**.
    *   Walk from hotel. Since it's Christmas season, the **"Christmas on A Great Street" light-up** will be on.
    *   **Dinner:** **Food Republic @ Wisma Atria** or **Tangs Market** (basement of Tang Plaza) for comfortable, air-conditioned hawker-style food.
    *   *Event:* Look out for the "Great Christmas Village" pop-ups along Orchard Road.

### **Day 2: Sentosa Island Fun (Sat, Dec 27)**
*   **09:30:** Transport to Sentosa.
    *   *Option A (Fastest):* Grab/Taxi directly to **Resorts World Sentosa (Casino/Underground drop-off)**.
    *   *Option B (Scenic):* Taxi to VivoCity -> Take **Sentosa Express Monorail** into the island.
*   **10:00:** **S.E.A. Aquarium**. (Spend ~2-3 hours). Indulge the toddler here; it's air-conditioned and stroller-friendly.
*   **13:00:** Lunch at **Malaysian Food Street** (Resorts World Sentosa) – good variety of local hawker food in AC.
*   **14:30:** **Skyline Luge & Skyride**.
    *   *Note:* Children under 6 years or under 110cm can ride the Luge in tandem with an adult (Child Doubling).
*   **17:00:** Head back to mainland/hotel.
*   **Evening:** Free and Easy. If energy permits, visit **Gardens by the Bay** for **Christmas Wonderland** (Ticketed event, huge crowds, buy ahead if interested).

### **Day 3: The Zoo Adventure (Sun, Dec 28)**
*   **08:00:** Breakfast & Depart.
    *   *Transport:* **Grab/Taxi is highly recommended**. It is a 25-30 min drive. Public transport (MRT + Bus) takes >1 hour and is draining.
*   **09:00:** **Singapore Zoo**.
    *   Go early to beat the heat. Rent a wagon/stroller at the entrance for the toddler (and bags).
    *   Don't miss the shows (Splash Safari, Rainforest Fights Back).
    *   Use the Tram (included in ticket usually) to save walking for seniors.
*   **14:00:** Late Lunch at Zoo entrance (KFC, Inuka Cafe) or head back to city.
*   **Afternoon:** Rest / Nap at hotel.
*   **18:00:** Dinner at **Newton Food Centre** (featured in *Crazy Rich Asians*). It’s touristy but near your hotel and offers a classic open-air hawker experience.

*   **09:30:** Check out. Store bags at Hotel Bell Desk.
*   **10:30:** Transport to **Suntec City**.
*   **11:00:** **Singapore DuckTours**.
    *   Departing from Suntec City. Tours take ~1 hour. Land + Water tour.
