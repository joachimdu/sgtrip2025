## 1. Pre-Trip Essentials & Logistics

### Airport Transfer (Highly Recommended)
*   **Recommendation:** **Book a Private Arrival Transfer (Maxi Cab / 7-Seater).**
*   **Why:** For a group of 6 with luggage, a toddler, and seniors, coordinating two separate Grab cars at a busy airport is stressful. A private driver will wait for you at the arrival hall.
*   **Cost:** Approx **SGD $65 - $75**.
*   **Alternative:** Queue for a "Maxi Cab" (7-seater) at the airport taxi stand (flat rate + surcharges), but availability isn't guaranteed.

### MRT & Transport
*   **MRT Passes:** Use foreign **contactless bank cards** (Visa/Mastercard) directly at the gantry (SimplyGo).
*   **Toddler (2-3 years old):**
    *   Travels **FREE**.
    *   **Action:** If taller than 0.9m, bring their passport to the Ticket Office at Changi Airport MRT station to get a **free Child Concession Card**.
*   **Getting Around:** For your group size, a **6-Seater Grab (GrabXL)** is often more convenient and similarly priced to 6 MRT fares for short trips.

### Payment Methods
*   **Credit/Debit Cards (Visa/Mastercard):** Accepted almost everywhere (Malls, Attractions, Taxis, many Restaurants).
*   **Cash (SGD):** Essential for **Hawker Centres** and small shops. Withdraw cash at Changi Airport ATMs upon arrival.
*   **GrabPay (for Tourists):**
    *   **Grab Services (Rides, Food Delivery):** Link your foreign credit/debit card to your Grab app directly. This works seamlessly.
    *   **In-Store Payments (QR Code):** While GrabPay is widely accepted, using your contactless foreign credit/debit card (SimplyGo) or cash is often simpler for tourists due to potential complexities with topping up the GrabPay wallet balance with foreign cards.
*   **GCash (via Alipay+):**
    *   **How:** Look for merchants displaying the **Alipay+** logo. You can pay directly from your GCash app.
    *   **Benefits:** Real-time exchange rates, often no service fees for cross-border payments. Transactions show in both SGD and PHP.
    *   **Limitations:** Acceptance may be limited to specific stores/tourist areas. Some foreign transaction fees may apply.
*   **Maya (Physical Debit Card):**
    *   **How:** Use your **physical Maya debit card** (tap-to-pay) wherever Visa is accepted.
    *   **Benefits:** Works for ATM withdrawals, tap-to-pay purchases in shops/hawker centers, and public transport (MRT/bus).
    *   **Limitations:** The **Maya app cannot be used** for payments in Singapore. Public transport fares may incur a small admin fee.
*   **GoTyme (Visa Debit Card):**
    *   **How:** Use your **GoTyme Visa debit card** wherever Visa is accepted (tap-to-pay).
    *   **Benefits:** Works for purchases, public transport (MRT/bus), good conversion rates, real-time transaction updates. No international travel notification needed.
    *   **Limitations:** ATM withdrawals incur fees. May have transaction limits.
*   **Apps:** Download **Grab** (for ride-hailing and food delivery) and set it up with your credit card before flying.

### Booking Ahead (Crucial)
*   **Singapore Zoo:** **Mandatory** to book timeslots online.
*   **Singapore DuckTours:** Book a late afternoon slot (4:30 PM or 5:30 PM) for Day 1.
*   **Jacob Ballas:** Free entry, no booking needed, but **check opening hours (Closed Mondays)**.

### SIM Card / Mobile Data (for Mobile WiFi Device)
*   **Recommendation:** Purchase a **Tourist SIM Card** upon arrival at Changi Airport.
*   **Where to Buy:**
    *   **Changi Airport (Strongly Recommended):** Telco kiosks (Singtel, StarHub, M1) are available in the arrival halls of all terminals, or at Changi Recommends counters. This ensures immediate connectivity.
    *   **Convenience Stores:** 7-Eleven or Cheers outlets also sell pre-paid SIM cards from the major telcos, available island-wide.
*   **Providers:** Major telcos are **Singtel, StarHub, and M1**. All offer tourist-specific prepaid SIMs with generous data allowances.
*   **What to Ask For:** A **"Tourist SIM"** or **"Data SIM"** suitable for a mobile WiFi device. They will help you register it (passport required).

## 2. Strategic Itinerary

### **Day 1: City Orientation & Culture (Fri, Dec 26)**
*   **09:45:** Arrival at Changi T4. Immigration & Baggage.
*   **11:00:** Private Transfer to Hotel (Jen Tanglin).
*   **12:00:** Drop bags / Early Check-in. Lunch at **Tanglin Mall** (e.g., *Tanglin Cookhouse* or Food Court).
*   **14:00:** **Singapore Botanic Gardens (Tanglin Gate)**.
    *   *Distance from Hotel:* **~1 km** (to Tanglin Gate).
    *   *Transport:* **Walk (10-15 mins)** or Short Taxi ride.
    *   *Activity:* Explore the beautiful UNESCO World Heritage site. You can enjoy a leisurely stroll, see the swans at Eco Lake, or visit the National Orchid Garden (ticketed, but highly recommended). It's a more relaxed start after arrival.
    
    **OR (Alternative Option): Gardens by the Bay (Cloud Forest / Flower Dome)**
    *   *Why choose this:* If you prefer **air-conditioning** over an outdoor walk, or want to be closer to the next stop (DuckTours).
    *   *Distance from Hotel:* **~7 km**.
    *   *Transport:* **Taxi/Grab (15-20 mins)** from Hotel.
    *   *Logistics:* Spend 1.5 - 2 hours here. It is very close to Suntec City, making the transfer to DuckTours quick and easy.
    *   *Note:* Requires paid tickets (Book ahead!).
*   **16:00:** Transport to **Suntec City**.
    *   *Distance:* **~6 km**.
    *   *Transport:* **Taxi/Grab (15 mins)** from Jacob Ballas.
*   **17:30:** **Singapore DuckTours** (Sunset Slot).
    *   *Why:* Perfect introduction to the city (Marina Bay, Civic District) from both land and water without walking. It’s cooler at this time.
*   **19:00:** Dinner at **Maxwell Food Centre** & **Chinatown**.
    *   *Distance:* **~2.5 km**.
    *   *Transport:* **Taxi/Grab (5-10 mins)** from Suntec.
    *   *Must-Eats:* **Tian Tian Chicken Rice** (Maxwell), **Ondeh-Ondeh** (snacks).
    *   *After Dinner:* Walk around Chinatown/Buddha Tooth Relic Temple (Exterior) which is beautifully lit at night.

### **Note on Itinerary Logic (Day 2 vs Day 3)**
*   **Why Sentosa on Saturday?** We scheduled Sentosa first because it offers a mix of indoor (Aquarium) and outdoor activities. This gives your group (especially the toddler and seniors) a chance to **acclimatize** to Singapore's heat with significant breaks in air-conditioning.
*   **Why Zoo on Sunday?** The Singapore Zoo is almost entirely outdoors and is the most physically demanding activity. Placing it on Sunday allows everyone to build up stamina and adjust to the humidity before tackling the "big walk."

### Day 2: Sentosa Island Fun (Sat, Dec 27)
*   **09:30:** Transport to **Resorts World Sentosa**.
    *   *Distance from Hotel:* **~9 km**.
    *   *Transport:* **Taxi/Grab (20 mins)** directly to the Casino/Underground drop-off point.
    *   *Timing Logic:* S.E.A. Aquarium opens at **10:00 AM**. Leaving at 9:30 ensures you arrive right as doors open, beating the heavy Saturday queues that form by 10:30 AM.
*   **10:00:** **S.E.A. Aquarium**. (Air-conditioned & stroller friendly).
*   **13:00:** Lunch at **Malaysian Food Street** (RWS) or **Din Tai Fung** (RWS) for kid-friendly dumplings.
*   **14:30:** **Skyline Luge & Skyride** (Beach Station).
    *   *Distance:* **~2 km** (Internal Sentosa travel).
    *   *Transport:* Take the **Sentosa Express Monorail** (Free within island) from Resorts World Station to Beach Station.
    *   *Note:* Toddlers under 6 years/110cm can ride the Luge in tandem with an adult.
*   **17:00:** Relax at **Siloso Beach** (Coastes is a nice beach bar) or head back to the city.
*   **Evening:** Free & Easy.

### **Day 3: The Zoo Adventure (Sun, Dec 28)**
*   **08:00:** Breakfast & Depart.
    *   *Distance from Hotel:* **~22 km**.
    *   *Transport:* **Book two Taxis or a 6-seater Grab (30-40 mins)**.
    *   *Why:* Public transport (MRT + Bus) takes >1 hour and involves transfers.
*   **09:00:** **Singapore Zoo**.
    *   *Strategy:* Rent a wagon for the toddler. Use the Tram to save the seniors' legs.
    *   *Shows:* Splash Safari (10:30am), Rainforest Fights Back (12:00pm).
*   **14:00:** Late Lunch at Zoo Entrance (KFC / Inuka Cafe) or return to city.

    *   *Distance from Hotel:* **~1 km** (to Tanglin Gate).
    *   *Transport:* **Walk (10-15 mins)** or Short Taxi ride.
    *   The main gardens (UNESCO site) are open. You can see the Swans at the Eco Lake or the Orchid Garden.

## 3. Food & Dining Recommendations

**Local "Must-Eats":**
1.  **Hainanese Chicken Rice:**
    *   *Tian Tian Chicken Rice* (Maxwell Food Centre) - The most famous, expect a queue.
    *   *Boon Tong Kee* (Multiple locations) - Air-conditioned restaurant style, very good.
2.  **Bak Kut Teh (Pork Rib Soup):**
    *   *Song Fa Bak Kut Teh* (Multiple locations, e.g., The Centrepoint near your hotel) - Peppery style, very popular.
3.  **Chilli Crab / Black Pepper Crab:**
    *   *Jumbo Seafood* (Riverside or Dempsey) - Pricey but iconic. **Reservation essential**.
    *   *Keng Eng Kee (KEK) Seafood* (Alexandra Village) - More local/hawker style, famous for "Moonlight Hor Fun" too.
4.  **Kaya Toast (Breakfast):**
    *   *Ya Kun Kaya Toast* or *Toast Box* - Found in almost every mall.
5.  **Dim Sum:**
    *   *Din Tai Fung* (Paragon / Wisma Atria / RWS) - World-famous, very consistent, kid-friendly.

## 4. Addressing Your Questions

1.  **DuckTours Priority & Trade-offs:**
    *   **Verdict:** Doing it Day 1 is a great idea.
    *   **Trade-off:** You might be tired from the flight.
    *   **Solution:** Book a **5:30 PM slot**. This gives you time to rest at the hotel midday and avoids the afternoon heat. It leads perfectly into dinner.
    *   **Jacob Ballas Issue:** We moved Jacob Ballas to Day 1 (2pm) because it is **closed on Mondays**. If 2pm is too hot/rushed, you might have to skip it or visit the main Botanic Gardens on Monday instead.
2.  **Maxwell & Chinatown:**
    *   **Placement:** Day 1 Evening (after DuckTours). It is geographically close to Suntec (DuckTours location) via a short taxi ride.
3.  **Restaurants:**
    *   See the new "Food & Dining Recommendations" section above.
4.  **Private Airport Transfer:**
    *   **Yes, highly recommended.** The convenience of having a driver wait for a group of 6 (with seniors + toddler) outweighs the ~$20 savings compared to coordinating two Grabs. It sets a stress-free tone for the trip.

## 5. Estimated Trip Budget

**Important Considerations for Dec 26-29 (Peak Season):**
1.  **Surcharges:** Expect higher "surge" prices for Grab rides and potential festive menu pricing at restaurants.
2.  **Toddler Savings:** Your 2-year-old enters the Zoo and Aquarium for **free**. The main costs for them are the DuckTours seat and Luge "doubling" ticket.
3.  **Senior Discounts:** Carry passports to prove age (60+) for significant discounts at the Zoo and Aquarium.
